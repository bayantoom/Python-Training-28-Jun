# Python Training Day 5

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


## Data Structures: 

### Linked List: 
- **Sequence of elements where each element points to the next element.**


### Doubly Linked List:
- **A linked list in which each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node.**
- **This allows for more efficient traversal in both directions.**


### Stack: 
- **A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.**


### Queue: 
- **A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.**


### Binary Search Tree:
- **A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, and the nodes are ordered in a specific way.**


### Tree Traversal:
**The process of visiting each node in a tree data structure in a specific order.**
- **Inorder**: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
- **Preorder**: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
- **Postorder**: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
